# Octopus Store

This is my dummy implementation of online store for studying purposes inspired by https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnWeb.
Tools I am using here: ASP.NET Core 2.1, Angular 6, XUnit, bootstrap.
Principles and patterns: huge emphasis on SOLID principles, RESTful WEB API, clean architecture, microservices, repository pattern, specification pattern.

### Installing

Just clone and run server, no special actions required
