# Osprey Store

Osprey Store is web store platform (inspired by Amazon) providing marketplace for the sellers and the customers. It was created with a purpose to became familiar and implement software with some fancy frameworks and patterns. 
Front-End is not completed yet, and Back-end still requires some refactoring and documenting, but nearing completion state. 
I hope you can find some useful pieces of code there.
